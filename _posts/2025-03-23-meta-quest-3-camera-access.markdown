I've been playing with the new Camera Access passthrough feature on the Meta Quest 3, and I think it's going to change how we think about mixed reality.
</div>

## What is it?

In simple terms, Meta has opened up the Quest 3's cameras to developers. While the headset could already show you a video feed of your surroundings (basic passthrough), now apps can actually process what the cameras see and do interesting things with that information.

## Why it matters

This isn't just a minor technical update. It fundamentally changes what's possible in mixed reality by allowing applications to understand and respond to your physical environment.

## Five cool things this enables

1. **Smart home redecoration**: Apps can scan your room, recognize furniture, and show how new pieces would look with proper scale and lighting.
2. **Fitness coaching that watches your form**: Workout apps can now see if you're doing exercises correctly and offer adjustments.
3. **Better remote collaboration**: Share physical objects in meetings just by holding them up - the other person's headset can process what you're showing them.
4. **Navigation that makes sense**: Directions overlaid directly on your actual surroundings, with real-time recognition of landmarks.
5. **Arts and creativity**: Use the real world as your canvas or starting point for digital art.

The most interesting applications will likely be ones we haven't thought of yet. This is one of those platform capabilities that enables a whole new category of applications.

## Early days

The feature was just released, and developers are still figuring out the possibilities. There are privacy considerations to work through, and the first wave of applications will probably be relatively simple.
